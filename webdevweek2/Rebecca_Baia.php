        <h1> <strong> Hi! Im Becca!</strong> </h1>
        <br /><br />
        I'm Buffalo-born and raised. I grew up in the North Buffalo and Williamsville areas, working in bars and
        restaurants around the area. After graduating from Williamsville North, I went on to SUNY Fredonia for a single
        semester. I realized that I
        had no idea what I wanted and was not mentally prepared to commit to a collegiate program.
        <br /><br />
        From 2011 through 2014, I invested my time co-managing my friend's restaurant, "The Stuffed Hot Pepper" on
        Transit and working with my friend's startup. The team was called Castle Company Services, and I assisted in
        developing
        an inventory management system for independent restaurants in the WNY area. I was tasked with recruiting
        developers at RIT and UB to build the
        basic framework and reach out to restaurants and local distributors to see if they were interested in
        participating and writing content for the website.

        Overall, I wouldn't recommend moving to a city you've never visited before. Without a job. And without a plan.
        By yourself. Long story short, I got the job. How in the world did that happen? They needed a publicist for team
        Insomniac. I was the only interviewee with the right skill set that understood the culture surrounding dance
        music and music festivals. Along with the fact I was the only one crazy enough to move across the country
        without a guaranteed job.
        <br />
        I moved back to Buffalo in 2019, my friend Jason had started his own construction company and brought me on as
        Cheif Operations Officer handling all marketing and general day to day duties.

        Additionally, I handle payroll, general budgeting, HR, and incoming inquries.
        <br />
        <br />
        I wanted to make more money as startups don't pay well. I joined my former employer as their Media Relations
        Coordinator in Aug. 2019, assisting in increasing their local visibility and helping the attorneys with bylines
        and media opportunities. Between my experiences in Las Vegas and my overall experience at my previous employer
        is
        the reason I morally do not feel good about doing public relations moving forward. I did not realize that it was
        a corporate defense law firm before joining. I found myself writing and pitching articles that I found didn't
        bring many benefits to
        society.
        <br />
        What finally ripped my soul out of my body was when I was tasked with writing a byline for
        <italics>Law360</italics> supporting fracking in New York. I ended up writing an article that helped the
        pipeline that I had gone door to door with NYPIRG in 2016 to lobby support against it successfully. You can
        check that out, <a

        <h4>Why Im Here</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I have been unemployed since April.</li>
            <li>At my former employer one of the most significant issues we had was the digital team vs. the content
                team (me) vs. the web team. The ongoing discussion was that the content team wouldn't write things that
                would help
                optimize the website to increase traffic. Although we couldn't connect with the backend
                developers when we had questions. My goal here is to gain a more comprehensive understanding of frontend
                and
                backend programming to create websites with a more coherent flow from design, to user experience, to
                content. </li>
            <li>I've given my heart and soul to my role just to be deemed non-essential. I never want that to happen
                again. </li>
            <li>In the past three years, I've seen my industry shrink and lean more towards computer led interactions
                and code
                generated press releases.</li>
            <li> I believe my background as a content writer, with my inherent interest in technology and my history of
                being a self-starter, will bring me success in this field. </li>
